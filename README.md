# snyk_public_python
Python function allowing to retrieve all the available information about a module from snyk in a machine-readable form. Allows to retrieve information about open-source modules, available in package managers supported by snyk.io. I use it for research purposes. 
## Requirements: 
#### Node.js snyk module (install it globally using Node.js CLI - described on snyk.io)
#### SNYK_TOKEN in evnironmental variables (get one for free after registering on snyk.io)
#### NODE_ENV in evnironmental variables (like C:\CSPA17\NodeJS\node-v6.11.2-win-x64)
#### Python 3.6+ (was not tested on 2.x)
#### Naked module for python - allows to run JS code in python (pip install Naked)

## How to use:
There is a Jupyter Notebook script with comments. Please let me know if anything is unclear.
